If you want to customize it, please have a look to Settings -> WP Attachments3. You will also notice a new metabox while editing a post, page or whatever custom post type. In addition you can find new features in the media page: "Attach"+"Reattach"== Frequently Asked Questions === How can i hide the list for a certain page? =While in the edit screen, you will see the plugin metabox that lists every file uploaded to the content. At the bottom-right of this metabox you can easily turn off the automatic listing by checking **Disable**. = How can i avoid double listing? =When you upload a file, you usually click to insert the link in the content. Please note that this action is not required with WP Attachments. When you upload a file, WordPress assigns it to the content ID (even if its link is not inserted as html) and WP Attachments will show it. Instead of clicking "Insert in this page", just click "X" in the upper right corner of the media popup. The file will still be there, and this plugin will show it!= How can i reorder files? =Just drag them while editing the page (in WP Attachments metabox or Media Popup)= Developer Filters =WP Attachments includes many filters to allow developers easily change its behaviour :)* **wpatt_list_html** ~ list output ($html > $html)* **wpatt_before_entry_html** ~ single entry output (before %TAG% parsing) ($html > $html)* **wpatt_after_entry_html** ~ single entry output (after %TAG% parsing) ($html > $html)* **wpatt_accepted_formats** ~ alter files to shows ($mime > $boolean)Examples:`function my_custom_function( $html ) { //Alter final html    return $new_html;}add_filter( 'wpatt_list_html', 'my_custom_function' );``function my_custom_function( $mime ) { //This snippet shows only PDF in the list    if ( $mime == 'applicationpdf') {        return true;    }	return false;}add_filter( 'wpatt_accepted_formats', 'my_custom_function' );`== Screenshots ==1.
