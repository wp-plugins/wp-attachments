Cool. Automatic. Simple. As it has to be!== Description ==This plugin automatically shows every file attached to a page or post under its content.Every time we upload a file in our wordpress website, we should insert a link into the text area in order to show the file attached. This process is sometimes a waste of time and, expecially for government or school websites where the main information is based on files rather than 'post content', this plugin give a great added value!Once activated, every page, post or custom post type will show the list of the attachments uploaded there.The plugin includes some great options to personalize/localize the front-end. More options and functions will be added soon!= Upcoming Features =* Fast and intuitive attachments edit for backend* More customizationPlease note that this is pratically a new plugin continuously updated focused on semplicity, intuitiveness and cleanness.= Translation =While the plugin backend is in English, you can customize the front-end strings in the WP-Attachments option panel.= Help & Support =For any information or support feel free to contact me (**milesimarco AT outlook DOT com**) or use the Wordpress support forum.== Installation ==1.
