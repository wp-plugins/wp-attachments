It's light and focused on simplicity.== Description ==WP Attachments **automatically** shows every file uploaded to a page/post/custom-post-type below its content, without having to insert the link in the text area. This plugin is helpful when you want to use WordPress as a CMS with a big amount of media files (for ex. Government, Schools,...). In these cases manually insert a link may in fact be a waste of time. Now WP Attachments has also a very functional **metabox** for the back-end that helps you to better organise your attachments (upload, reorder, fast link add, and more!).Here is an example of a government website running WP Attachments): [www.comune.sanpellegrinoterme.bg.it](http://www.comune.sanpellegrinoterme.bg.it/documenti/regolamenti/) (yeah, that's the "Liberty" city where the famous water is born. What about visiting it? :) )Once activated, every page, post or custom post type will show the list of the attachments uploaded there. In the plugin settings (under Settings > Wp Attachments), you can choose the title and decide if show the attachment upload date or consider images as attachments.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgFzeWxAhF0> **COOL**!
