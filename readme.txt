Cool. Automatic. Simple. As it has to be!== Description ==This plugin automatically shows every file attached to a page or post under its content.Every time we upload a file in our wordpress website, we should insert a link into the text area in order to show the file attached. This process is sometimes a waste of time and, expecially for government or school websites where the main information is based on files rather than 'post content', this plugin give a great added value!Once activated, every page, post or custom post type will show the list of the attachments uploaded there.The plugin includes some great options to personalize/localize the front-end.== Installation ==1. Install the plugin either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server2. After activating, you've all done. If you want to personalize/localize the front-end, please have a look to Settings -> WP Attachments== Screenshots ==1. The automatic list created2.
