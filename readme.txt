Focused on simplicity.== Description ==WP Attachments automatically shows every file uploaded to a page/post below its content, without having to link it into the text area. This is intended for using WordPress as a CMS for helping clients dealing with a big amount of media files. Manually insert a link is usually a waste of time and, expecially for government or school websites where the main information is based on files rather than 'post content', this plugin gives a great added value (and saves a lot of time)!Once activated, every page, post or custom post type will show the list of the attachments uploaded there. In the plugin settings (under Settings > Wp Attachments), you can choose the title for the list, decide if show the attachment upload date or consider images as attachments.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgFzeWxAhF0> **COOL** // WP Attachments generates a simple yet elegant and functional list!> **AUTOMATIC** // Once configured, you can forget it: every time a post, page or custom post type is published, a list of every attachment upladed there will be shown below the content!> **SIMPLE** // WP Attachments can be configured in less than 2 minutes, and then it works automatically!The plugin includes some great options to personalize/localize the front-end.
